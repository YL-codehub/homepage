Cette vitesse est la rapidité avec laquelle vous ressentez le temps. Toutes les théories doivent supposer quelque chose qu’elles ne peuvent pas prouver : en RG, la vitesse de la lumière est supposée être toujours la même où que la mesure soit effectuée et la vitesse totale espace+temps de tout objet est égale à la vitesse de la lumière.\nLes mathématiques de la RG suggèrent que nous vivons sur une feuille de papier (mais en réalité 4 dimensions, pas 2) qui peut être pliée lorsqu’il y a un objet massif dessus. Lorsque vous tombez de l’espace vers une planète, c’est comme glisser le long d’un toboggan qui mène à la planète. En regardant la courbe du toboggan, vous pouvez voir que la notion d’espace et de temps dépend de l’endroit où vous êtes (mais aussi de quand). Une ligne courbe est en effet plus longue qu’une ligne droite : cela explique pourquoi différentes personnes vivent des temps de voyage différents dans l’espace et le temps. Vous ou n’importe quoi (planètes, trous noirs, gaz, etc., mais aussi lumière) subissez la courbure de l’espace-temps et en retour, la courbez également. Toujours là ? Bien."

Les orbites sont presque toutes circulaires, dans la même direction (sauf Vénus et Uranus), et toutes dans le même plan. Comme toutes les planètes faisaient partie de la même nuée de matière en orbite autour du soleil, leurs nombreux traits communs ne sont pas surprenants !\nLa gravité n’est pas spécifique à notre système. Nos planètes et étoiles n’ont rien de spécial non plus. Le même agencement pourrait exister pour les ~100 milliards d’étoiles de notre galaxie, la Voie lactée. Les astronomes ont calculé qu’il y a en moyenne au moins 1 planète par étoile : beaucoup de possibilités pour les colonies spatiales. Cependant, il nous faudrait 100 000 ans pour traverser même dans le meilleur des cas (à la vitesse de la lumière !), en ajoutant les détours autour du trou noir supermassif au centre de notre galaxie : Sagittarius A*. Les trous noirs supermassifs sont également des caractéristiques typiques des galaxies, à leur centre où la matière s’effondre."

La Voie lactée appartient à un super-amas de galaxies appelé ‘Virgo’, un million de fois plus grand. Certains mouvements de ces galaxies ont été mesurés depuis la Terre. En 1929, Edwin Hubble a mesuré que certaines galaxies s’éloignent de nous et du super-amas, plus elles sont loin, plus elles s’éloignent rapidement. Il semble que les distances augmentent partout : c’est une preuve que l’univers est en expansion.\nCependant, à une certaine distance de nous, les galaxies restent avec nous et le cluster et pourraient même se rapprocher. Nous verrons que cela provient de la compétition entre deux forces : la gravité et l’expansion, toutes deux décrites par la RG. Si l’expansion continue, il est difficile de prédire exactement combien de galaxies resteront dans Virgo ; il sera probablement séparé en une centaine de sous-amas de galaxies, qui pourraient se regrouper davantage jusqu’à fusionner en super galaxies."

Leur distribution dans l’espace a un schéma de toile clair : les super-amas se sont regroupés avec d’autres grâce à la gravité, mais aussi des bulles vides se sont formées grâce à l’expansion de l’univers.\nComment est-ce possible ? On a l’impression qu’il y a quelque chose qui pousse les choses au loin que nous ne pouvons pas voir. Mais nous pouvons le voir et c’est partout : la matière, la lumière, tout ce qui a de l’énergie dilate l’espace et c’est quelque chose que nous apprenons en écrivant l’équation de la RG pour l’univers. Cependant, il y a aussi quelque chose qui accélère cette expansion, ce qui explique pourquoi nous pensons que l’expansion ne s’arrêtera pas et ne s’inversera pas. Aucun des types habituels de matière, de lumière ou de forces ne permet cela : pouvez-vous imaginer quelque chose avec une pression négative ? Il y a autre chose là-bas, mais personne ne sait ce que c’est et c’est pourquoi on l’appelle maintenant l’énergie noire. Nous ne connaissons que certaines de ses propriétés et sa quantité dans l’univers (~70% !)."

Cela montre ce que vous voyez depuis le centre du ballon, vous (galaxie) et vos amis environnants (galaxies). Certains de vos amis sont assez loin pour se tenir à la surface du ballon : c’est l’expansion. Certains d’entre eux se connaissent et se tiennent par la main ou se font des câlins : c’est la gravité. Vous pouvez imaginer que l’expansion a empêché certains d’entre eux de saisir les mains des autres ou les vôtres, voire même a rompu certaines poignées de main.\nDonc, si l’univers est actuellement un gros ballon gonflé ; que se passe-t-il en remontant dans le temps ? Arrivez-vous à étreindre tous vos amis ? Qu’est-ce qu’un point qui s’embrasse lui-même ? Eh bien, c’est essentiellement l’origine des temps et c’est compliqué. Quelle est la bonne façon de remonter dans le temps ? C’est le travail des chercheurs de le découvrir et tout dépend du contenu de l’univers dans le temps. Pour l’instant, nous avons découvert que tous les types de matière, lumière et force habituels disparaissent dans un plasma chaud avant d’atteindre le ballon ponctuel. Les gens pensaient que le Big Bang était là : laissez-moi vous expliquer pourquoi ce n’est pas le cas."

Mais à quelle vitesse se produit l’expansion ? J’ai mentionné plus tôt que plus un objet est éloigné de nous, plus il s’éloigne rapidement : y a-t-il une distance après laquelle cela pourrait être plus rapide que la lumière ? Non. L’expansion ne change pas la vitesse des galaxies mais rend le trajet plus long entre elles. Cela signifie toujours que la lumière envoyée de nous ou d’un voisin lointain pourrait devoir rivaliser avec une distance croissante, et parfois l’expansion l’emporte. Imaginez faire du golf sur un green en expansion… Parfois, la communication (c’est-à-dire la lumière atteignant d’une zone à une autre) est impossible entre deux régions de l’univers. C’est la raison pour laquelle même avec des outils puissants, nous ne pouvons pas voir l’ensemble de l’univers.\nNous parvenons toujours à recevoir des signaux micro-ondes du plasma du Big-Bang, voyageant encore aujourd’hui, venant de toutes les directions. L’analyse de ce signal a suggéré que des endroits trop éloignés les uns des autres pour avoir jamais été en contact à cette époque avaient en fait interagi (par exemple avec la même lumière). À partir de cette découverte dans les années 60, les gens ont décidé qu’il fallait un pré-Big-Bang (ou une extension) pour permettre un temps de ‘contact’ et l’ont appelé inflation."

Comme elle est principalement décrite par la RG, ses descriptions ne peuvent pas se passer de mathématiques. Le rôle de nombreux chercheurs est de proposer un modèle mathématique pour l’inflation et de calculer ce qu’il donne à des moments ultérieurs, à l’époque du plasma et même jusqu’à aujourd’hui. Enfin, vous comparez votre prédiction avec le signal mesuré : vous notez les modèles, et vous gardez le meilleur (le plus proche des mesures) : c’est ce que fait la science moderne.\nLes empreintes de l’inflation sur le signal micro-onde sont subtiles mais en disent long sur les propriétés de ‘ce qui’ était présent pendant l’inflation. Nous savons maintenant que l’inflation a principalement vu un type d’énergie sombre – appelé inflaton – dominer, un type de pression négative. Encore une fois, un tel fluide déclenche l’expansion, ici la plus rapide de l’histoire de l’univers : taille multipliée par 1 [insérez 138 zéros], en environ 0. [insérez au moins 32 zéros] 1 seconde. De même que l’expansion de l’univers d’aujourd’hui, c’est comme être sur une feuille 2D d’espace-temps : c’est comme si un être de dimension supérieure étirait la feuille tout autour de vous. La principale différence avec l’expansion d’aujourd’hui est que l’univers était petit et donc soumis aux effets quantiques."

L’origine (dans le temps) de cette inhomogénéité est supposée être la physique quantique pendant l’inflation. En remontant dans le temps, l’univers pourrait atteindre des échelles inférieures à ce que nous ne pouvons pas voir avec nos yeux et même plus petites. Mais dans ce cas, les choses ne suivent plus ce que l’on appelle la physique classique.\nLa physique classique est la science prédéterminée de ce que nous voyons tous les jours ; connaissant suffisamment de détails sur un système à un moment donné (masse, position, vitesse…), vous pouvez prédire l’évolution du système dans le temps et ce que vous mesurerez. Parfois, il vous manque des informations sur le système, et vous devez supposer différents scénarios pour le début et donc l’évolution.

Un objet quantique peut être dans plusieurs états en même temps, comme s’il n’avait pas encore choisi d’état dans notre réalité jusqu’à ce que vous le mesuriez, alors que dans la physique classique, les choses existent déjà indépendamment de vous mais vous ne savez peut-être pas encore dans quel état. La façon la plus simple de le représenter est, encore une fois, de suggérer qu’il y a quelque chose en jeu dans une dimension supplémentaire. Nous introduisons généralement des fonctionnalités supplémentaires pour la probabilité dans l’espace et le temps ; permettant aux probabilités d’avoir une dimension angulaire appelée ‘phase’. Deux particules peuvent ainsi interagir comme des vagues, mais avec plus de complexité, par exemple, leur interférence (somme) dépend beaucoup de leur angle et peut annuler la probabilité de l’autre ou la renforcer.\nPour une onde de probabilité quantique donnée, certaines équations et principes dictent quelles formes sont autorisées dans l’espace et le temps. Par exemple, une onde peut avoir une probabilité concentrée dans l’espace (2ème esquisse) mais implique une probabilité super étendue pour toutes les vitesses autorisées (3ème esquisse). L’inverse est également autorisé, mais les probabilités de positions et de vitesses trop précisément connues simultanément sont impossibles : incertitude quantique en jeu."

Cependant, le vide quantique ne signifie pas strictement ‘0’ de quoi que ce soit, contrairement à la physique classique, car même au niveau le plus bas, la physique quantique montre des fluctuations d’énergie dans ce vide.\nThéoriquement, le vide quantique ne peut pas avoir strictement 0 énergie, sinon cela contredirait l’incertitude quantique. Si nous définissons le vide comme l’absence de toute particule mesurée ; des paires de particules non mesurables sont autorisées à émerger de rien et à s’annihiler avant que vous ayez le temps de les mesurer. Ces particules sont appelées ‘virtuelles’, mais cela ne signifie pas qu’elles n’existent pas ; elles peuvent être mesurées indirectement en mesurant d’autres particules réelles interagissant avec elles. Dans tous les cas, nous savons avec certitude qu’il y a un processus énergétique en jeu apportant des fluctuations à l’univers jeune, ce qui donnera aujourd’hui des fluctuations dans le ciel (par exemple, le nombre de galaxies)."

    "text": "NASA Champions Cohort overview\nThe NASA Openscapes Framework project is a 3-year project to support scientists using NASA Earthdata from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs), as they migrate workflows to the cloud. We are just wrapping up Year 1 and amazed at how much we have collectively accomplished this year with the DAAC mentors and participating DAACs as well as all the researchers and research teams we have worked with. You can read more about our first year in our 2021 annual report. \nAs part of this work, with the DAAC mentors, we co-led our first NASA Openscapes Champions cohort. Based on Openscapes’ flagship program, Openscapes Champions, theNASA Openscapes Champions Cohort was a professional development and mentorship opportunity for early adopter, science teams that use NASA Earthdata and were interested in migrating their existing workflows to the cloud through collaborative open data science practices. The Openscapes Champions Cohort ran formally in March - April 2022. \nThe ten research teams who participated were interested in a wide variety of NASA Earthdata and various stages of cloud technology familiarity. You can learn more about their research below. Together as a Champions cohort they discussed what worked and didn’t work as they migrated workflows to the cloud, with a focus on collaboration and open science. We met as a cohort five times over two months, on alternating Fridays. Each cohort call included a welcome and code of conduct reminder, two teaching sessions with time for reflection in small groups or silent journaling and group discussion, before closing with suggestions for future team meeting topics (“Seaside Chats”), Efficiency Tips, and Tips. Additional hands-on clinics and coworking sessions were scheduled within this period and will extend for the next two months to support these teams as they continue to work on the cloud workflow migration. In addition, the teams were supported by the Openscapes DAAC mentors and staff and Element84 and had access to Openscapes’ 2i2c Jupyter Hub, which will continue for the next year.\n\n\n\nZoomie class photo of NASA Champions"

    "text": "What did participants achieve?\nJust like our DAAC mentors have built collaborative bridges across the distributed data centers to identify the common parts of cloud data access over the first year of our project, this cohort was an opportunity to connect NASA Earthdata users, building a community that is eager to use data in the cloud and provides a forum to discuss common techniques and challenges. The teams devoted at least 8 hours a month to focus on their workflows. In this time, they thought through and discussed their current NASA Earthdata workflows and planned and experimented with transitioning their workflows to the cloud using Openscapes’ 2i2c-hosted Jupyter Hub as a first step. As in other Openscapes Champions cohorts, teams also realized the power of onboarding to create more resilient labs and they explored creating collaborative spaces for their teams through Google Drive, Slack, and GitHub. \nThemes we revisited throughout the cohort included: \nThe Open science underpinnings of the Openscapes Champions program are important. During our last Champions session when the teams presented their pathways, it was amazing to hear how many times that teams were trying to use Github, Gitlab, or taking away other Open science practices in addition to the cloud-specific. It wasn’t all or nothing, they were taking small steps. It was also great to hear that a takeaway from this cohort is, working more openly and reproducibly provides for a more resilient workflow and team. \nWe intentionally focus on providing a kind welcome to technical topics. The kind space that we co-created with the teams and DAAC mentors provided an opportunity to collaborate as teams and ask questions that may in other settings go unasked because of fear that everyone else already knows. (Note: everyone else doesn’t know and will be glad you asked!)   \nThis also led to several challenges that consistently surfaced and still need more focused effort to resolve. The vocabulary to understand the Cloud needs to be clearly explained. For example, what is an S3 bucket or a “requester pays bucket” and why does a user need to know about AWS West-2? Cloud cost is another challenge. We lower the barrier by providing the 2i2c Jupyterhub, but teams don’t want to depend on our hub. They want their own workspace and want to be able to predict costs more effectively. Finally, our work has been focused on Python because that was the language of choice for DAAC mentors and it is a widely used open-source language in the broader Earth science community. In the Champions Cohort we had three teams using Matlab and one team using R; we need to think about how to expand our support and tutorial materials for these other languages."

    "text": "Closing thoughts\nAs we indicated at the beginning of this blog, this transition isn’t one that is completed in 2.5 months and so this is not the end for this Cohort. We are moving from the structured sessions of the Champions program into two additional months of coworking time and 1-1 interactions with DAAC mentors and staff and Element84 in order to make lasting changes with cloud data access. \nWe will focus on specific topics like: \n\nPracticing GitHub workflows and teaching others on your team \nCloud spatial subsetting \nEnvironment management for creating cloud computing space that is reproducible and scalable (e.g. docker images) \nDask/Pangeo software stack to enable scalable processing \nCloud costs and setup \nNetCDF to Zarr\nDocker containers \n\nFinally, we are grateful to this Champion Cohort’s early adopter spirit, their time and effort to make this migration, and all of the feedback and input they provided. They all participated in this cohort knowing that they were some of the first research teams to use NASA Earthdata in the cloud and that they were the first NASA Openscapes Champions cohort. This meant that there would be technical challenges as we work out migrating to the cloud, yet what they learn will make it easier for subsequent teams making this same shift. It also exhibited the reciprocal learning that happens; we will refine the NASA Openscapes Champions as we plan for our next cohort and our work with the DAAC mentors in year 2."

    "text": "NASA Openscapes Champions Teams\nThe Cryosphere Geophysics and Remote Sensing (CryoGARS) Glaciology Team at Boise State University analyzes modern changes to the Earth’s cryosphere, with a focus on rapid changes in glacier flow, glacier-ocean interactions, iceberg melting, and seasonal snow accumulation and melt. Nearly all of our projects use Landsat imagery to map changes in glacier, iceberg, and/or snow extent. Several projects also use Landsat data to map glacier velocities or rely on NASA-produced glacier velocities computed from Landsat and Sentinel-2 data. We also use ICESat-2 data to map glacier volume change and seasonal snow in mountain regions. We look forward to using more cloud resources so that we can expand our analyses in space and time in order to advance our understanding of Cryosphere change!\nThe Mapes Team at the University of Miami studies atmospheric dynamics through multi-source data synthesis, with global grids as the glue. The global grids are huge, so downloading is out of the question. Fetching from aggregations (THREDDS, GDS) works for case studies, but sometimes we need to process it all (simplest example: make a multi-year climatology, to give context to actual fields as “anomalies”). So the data lake in the cloud will be a nice resource, and open new vistas like machine learning which always benefits from more data.\nThe Cornillon Team at the University of Rhode Island has several projects making use of MODIS and VIIRS sea surface temperature (SST). The project of focus for this cohort has been the statistical description of the location, strength, and temporal evolution of SST fronts. As part of this project, we developed an algorithm to unmask pixels improperly flagged as cloud contaminated in the standard MODIS SST products. The improved masks will be made available to the community at large as will the fronts identified by our edge detection algorithm. \nThe LoL Team has members from USGS, UCSB, and the University of Arizona. Kate uses dense time series of Landsat data to build harmonic models to predict land use cover and land use change and its links to climatological signals. Crista and Sarah research the human dimensions of earth observation data, such as Landsat. Nikki uses NASA drought models to map climate hazards in her Navajo Nation community. The research project “Power of the Pixel: Connecting Communities through Remote Sensing in the United States” combines the power of all three foci to use NASA/USGS Landsat data to build earth observation capacity in communities across the United States.\nThe SASSIE Team has members from the University of Washington, JPL, and APL. They are part of the NASA salinity and SWOT science teams, and regularly use satellite salinity, temperature, altimetry and sea ice data, as well as in situ holdings (SPURS-2, upcoming SASSIE experiment).\nThe Tandon Team at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth uses remotely sensed data to setup the larger scale perspectives for our more in depth analysis and cruise based work for in-situ experimental data from initiatives in the Indian Ocean such as ASIRI and MISOBOB.\nThe Palter Team at the University of Rhode Island uses NASA data to compare with in-situ observations taken from ships and Uncrewed Surface Vehicles. NASA data provides additional parameters (like ocean surface topography) that are useful in the understanding of in-situ data (for example identifying fronts in the ACC). We have also used ocean color data from MODIS-Aqua to map distributions of ocean surface properties, such as chlorophyll concentration & sea surface salinity (region-specific algorithm), to analyze seasonal, annual, and decadal trends of key biogeochemical processes in the ocean.\nThe Just Team at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai uses earth observations to reconstruct ground-level environmental exposures to fine particulate matter, air temperature, and humidity which we use in epidemiologic health studies with cohorts and large registries in the US and Mexico. In a project that started out by seeking to understand the pattern of error in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrievals, we have developed an R-based reproducible workflow using the targets package for collocating and correcting AOD from the MAIAC algorithm (product MCD19A2 for Aqua and Terra) versus ground stations using gradient-boosted machine learning. This workflow adds reproducibility and extensibility for further development and new applications, building on results we have published for AOD (https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10050803) and for column water vapor (https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-4669-2020; data/code in Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.3568449).\nThe Hain/SPoRT Team is a directly funded NASA activity and engages with operational stakeholders to transition unique NASA observations and capabilities to improve decision-making.\nThe Roberts Team supports evaluation of global energy and water budgets, develops retrieval algorithms and climate data records (e.g. SeaFlux V1), evaluates air-sea interaction and ocean winds, and downscales and bias corrects models for use in hydrologic and agricultural modeling)."

This speed is how fast you feel time. All theories have to pre-suppose something they can’t prove: in GR the speed of light is assumed to be always the same wherever the measure is done and the total time+space speed of any object is equal to the speed of light.\nGR’s Maths suggest that we live on a sheet of paper (but 4 dimensions in reality, not 2) that can be bent when there is a massive object on it. When you fall from space to a planet, it is the same as going along a slide that leads to the planet. When you look at the curve of the slide, you can see that the notion of space and time depends on where you are (but also when). A curved line is indeed longer than a straight one: that explains why different people experience different travel times in space and time. You or anything (planets, blackholes, gas etc, but also light) undergo the curve of spacetime and in return also bend it. Still here? Good."

Each of them has additional movements: they rotate around a North-South axis and this axis also slightly oscillates. The orbits are all almost circles, towards the same direction (except Venus and Uranus), and all in the same plane. Since all planets used to be part of the same cloud of matter orbiting around the sun, their numerous common traits are not surprising!\nGravity is not specific to our system. Our planet(s) and star have nothing special either. The same setup could exist for the ~100 billion stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way. Astronomists calculated at least 1 planet per star on average: a lot of possibilities for space colonies. However, it would take 100 000 years for us to travel across even in the best case (at light speed!), to which you add detours around the supermassive blackhole in the middle of our galaxy: Sagittarius A*.

It seems that distances everywhere become bigger: this is a proof that the universe is expanding.\nHowever, within a certain distance to us, galaxies stick with us and the cluster and might even get closer. We will see that it comes from the competition between two forces: gravity and expansion, both described with GR. If the expansion continues, it is difficult to predict exactly how many galaxies will stay within Virgo; it probably will be separated into a hundred subclusters of galaxies, which could cluster more until merging into super galaxies."

    "text": "Cosmic Web\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest scale we can probe from observations is called the ‘cosmic web’, 10 million of Virgo-like superclusters. Their distribution in space has a clear web pattern: superclusters have clustered with others thanks to gravity, but also empty bubbles have formed thanks to the expansion of the universe.\nHow is this possible? It feels like there is something growing or pushing things away that we can’t see. But we can see it and it’s everywhere: matter, light, anything with an energy dilates space and this is something we learn by writing the GR equation for the universe. However, there is also something accelerating that expansion, which is why we think that expansion won’t stop and reverse. None of the usual types of matter, light or forces allow that: can you imagine something with a negative pressure? something else is out there but nobody knows what it is and that’s why it is now called dark energy. We only know some of its properties and its quantity in the universe (~70%!)."

    "text": "A backward history of time\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the simplest ways to represent expansion is by using an (inaccurate) inflating balloon. It shows what you see from the center of the balloon, you (galaxy) and your surrounding friends (galaxies). Some of your friends are far enough to stand on the surface of the balloon: that’s the expansion. Some of them know each other and hold their hands or hug: that’s gravity. You can imagine that expansion hampered some of them to grab the hands of others or yours, or even broke some handshakes.\nSo, if the universe is currently a big, inflated balloon; what happens when going back in time? Do you get to hug all your friends? Can points hug? Well, that’s basically the origin of times and it’s complicated. What is even the right way to go back in time? This is researcher’s work to find out and it all depends on the content of the universe in time. For now, we discovered that all types of usual matter, light and force disappear into a hot plasma before we reach the point-like balloon. People thought the Big-Bang was there: let me explain you why it’s not."

I mentioned earlier that the further away an object is from us, the faster it recedes: is there a distance after which it could be faster than light? No. Expansion doesn’t change the velocity of galaxies but rather makes the journey longer between them. That still means that light sent from us or some far neighbour might have to compete with an increasing distance, and sometimes expansion wins. Can you imagine playing golf on an expanding green… Sometimes communication (i.e., light reaching from one area to another) is impossible between two regions of the universe. That’s the reason why even with powerful tools we can’t see the whole universe.\nWe still manage to receive microwave signals from the Big-Bang plasma, still travelling today, coming from all directions. The analysis of this signal suggested that places that were too far away from each other to have ever been in contact at that time, had actually interacted (for instance with the same light). From that discovery in the 60s, people decided we needed a pre-Big-Bang (or an extension) to allow a ‘contact’ time and called it inflation."

As it is mainly described by GR, its descriptions can’t go without mathematics. The role of many researchers is to propose a mathematical model for inflation and calculate what it gives at later times, at the plasma time and even until today. Finally, you compare your prediction with the measured signal: you score models, and you keep the best (the closest to measurements): that’s what modern science is.\nThe imprints of inflation on the microwave signal are subtle but tell a lot about the properties of ‘what’ was there during inflation. We now know that Inflation mainly saw a type of dark energy – called inflaton- dominating, a type of negative pressure. Again, such a fluid triggers expansion, here the fastest in the universe’s history: size multiplied by 1[insert 138 zeros], in approximately 0.[insert at least 32 zeros]1 seconds. Similarly, to today’s universe expansion, it is like being on a 2D sheet of spacetime: it feels like some higher dimensional being was stretching the sheet everywhere around you. The main difference with today’s expansion is that the universe was small and so subjected to quantum effects."

The origin (in time) of that inhomogeneity is thought to be quantum physics during Inflation. Backward in time, the universe might reach scales below what we cannot see with our eyeballs and even smaller. But in that case, things no longer follow what is called classical physics.\nClassical physics is the pre-determined science of what we see everyday; knowing enough details about a system at a given time (mass, position, velocity…), you can predict the evolution of the system in time and what you will measure. Sometimes, you are missing information about the system, and you must assume different scenarios for the start and so the evolution. Each scenario has a probability; here for instance an unprecise or incomplete measure of the initial position and velocity gives a lack of knowledge also later."

We usually introduce extra features for the probability in space and time; allowing probabilities to have an angular dimension called ‘phase’. Two particles’ can thus interact like waves, but with more complexity, e.g., their interference (sum) depends a lot on their angle and can annihilate each other’s probability or strengthen it.\nFor a given quantum probability wave, some equations and principles dictate which shapes are allowed in space and time. For instance, a wave can have a concentrated probability in space (2nd sketch) but implies a super spread probability for all allowed velocities (3rd sketch). The opposite is also allowed, but both positions and velocity probabilities too precisely simultaneously known is impossible: quantum uncertainty at play."

Physicists think that, far enough in the past, the universe made of inflaton could be in its lowest energy level, called vacuum. However, quantum vacuum doesn’t strictly mean ‘0’ of anything, as opposed to classical physics, because even at the lowest level quantum physics show energy fluctuations in that vacuum.\nTheoretically, quantum vacuum cannot have a strict 0 energy, otherwise it would contradict the quantum uncertainty. If we define vacuum as the absence of any measured particle; unmeasurable particles pairs are allowed to emerge from nothing and annihilate before you have time to measure them. Those particles are called ‘virtual’, but it doesn’t mean they don’t exist; they can be measured indirectly by measuring other real particles interacting with them. In all cases, we know for sure that there is some energetic process down there bringing fluctuations to the young universe, which will today give fluctuations in the sky (e.g. number of galaxies)."

Searching for mathematics or general descriptions of; the shape of France, the grass and plants cycle, the evolution of your weight or bitcoins or of a molecule; all of those might require the consideration of what is happening at smaller scales; Normandie, worms as organic recyclers, measure noise, all individuals in a market, random collisions with other particles etc. Some of them can be modeled as random background noise with defined probabilities, it’s called stochastic modeling.\nMost of times, there is a scale at which you can stop zooming because it has a negligible influence compared to your desired precision.

Non-Gaussian signatures are inherently present in primordial fluctuations due to the non-linearities produced by both general relativity and the fact that the inflaton potential responsible for driving inflation may be interacting.\nThe goal of this project is to analytically and numerically model nonlinear inflationary dynamics in order to make bispectrum and higher-order correlator predictions which encompass a much broader range of inflationary scenarios, including those with multiple fields. This is an important discriminant between competing inflation models that can be used to distinguish them observationally.\nAn important element of the project will be to exploit the new GRChombo numerical relativity pipeline to model these nonlinear effects using full 3D general relativistic simulations, comparing the results with perturbative analytic expectations from effective field theory. In the last years, consequent insights have been made by the DAMTP cosmology group lead by Dr. Paul Shellard, now able to constrain a wide range of these models by using innovative separable techniques to extract and reconstruct the bispectrum (three-point correlator) from Planck satellite maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Direct confrontation with new observational data sets, from both CMB experiments (Simons Observatory) and galaxy surveys (SDSS, DES etc), will guide and constrain the understanding of inflation in fundamental physics. Stochastic nonlinear methods have other wide-ranging applications, including the creation of primordial black holes and the generation of gravitational waves in the early universe.\n\n\n\nAbstract for newcomers\n\nI work on the cosmology of the early universe.

Following previous work on initial conditions for the power spectrum, this work extends the kinetic pre-inflation model to the derivation of the primordial bispectrum, related to 3-point correlations. We derive here the main perturbations contributing to the bispectrum thanks to the In-In formalism for different initial conditions of a simple constant slow-roll and single-field inflation. In addition to an oscillating locally-shaped bispectrum, it is found that the dependence on the time and nature of the transition between pre-inflation and inflation is strong. As a main result, UV and IR divergences are encountered for the non-Gaussianities, showed to be independent of the choice of the vacuum and so treated within the assumption of an old transition time compared to the experimental cutoff.\n\n\n\nAbstract for newcomers\n\nThis work studied a particular model of initial conditions for the universe, i.e. of a type of inflationary universe. While most models don’t incorporate any origin and focus on the inflation process itself, this model combine both aspects by providing an initial singularity at the start and then propagates the subsequent universe into a “kinetic” era before transitioning to the usual models with a stable inflation of the apparent size of the universe.\nAs this is quite a peculiar formulation, usual mathematical tools to compute post-inflation observable quantities need some careful study. This is what we did to compute the correlation between each 3 points of the sky at the time of the Hot Big-Bang following Inflation."

Attention has been paid to propose the simplest possible model, which obeys the necessary N-representability conditions, while accurately reproducing all available experimental data. The deconvolution of thermal effects makes it possible to obtain an experimental static density matrix, which can directly be compared with theoretical 1-RDM (reduced density matrix). It is found that above a 1% statistical noise level, the role played by Compton scattering data becomes negligible and no accurate 1-RDM is reachable. Since no thermal 1-RDM is available as a reference, the quality of an experimentally derived temperature-dependent matrix is difficult to assess. However, the accuracy of the obtained static 1-RDM, through the performance of the refined observables, is strong evidence that the Semi-Definite Programming method is robust and well adapted to the reconstruction of an experimental dynamical 1-RDM."

Non-Gaussian signatures are inherently present in primordial fluctuations due to the non-linearities produced by both general relativity and the fact that the inflaton potential responsible for driving inflation may be interacting.\nThe goal of this project is to analytically and numerically model nonlinear inflationary dynamics in order to make bispectrum and higher-order correlator predictions which encompass a much broader range of inflationary scenarios, including those with multiple fields. This is an important discriminant between competing inflation models that can be used to distinguish them observationally.\nAn important element of the project will be to exploit the new GRChombo numerical relativity pipeline to model these nonlinear effects using full 3D general relativistic simulations, comparing the results with perturbative analytic expectations from effective field theory.

Inflationrefers to the first instants of the universe which allowed an exponential growth of its size – and since then, the universe kept expanding. Stochastic refers to the mathematical description of the early universe’s quantum fluctuations; random fluctuations of energy in the initial vacuum propagated in time and produced an inhomogeneous universe; e.g. today super cluster of galaxies against empty millions of light years.\nThere is a time at which those perturbations are big enough to be accounted for with the rival theory of quantum physics: the General Relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes gravity between massive objects (e.g.; solar system; you and the Earth). We can make predictions about the future of these growing quantum perturbations from an Inflation model by using a numerical simulation of gravity. By doing so, I hope to support the growing link between these two theories (Quantum Physics and General Relativity).
