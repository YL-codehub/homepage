I'm a PhD student in **Quantum Cosmology** at the Department of Applied Mathematics 
and Theoretical Physics at the **University of Cambridge**.

The essence of this website is multiple but mainly professional and functional — 
hence a deliberately minimalist pattern.

## What you'll find here

On this website, you will be able to find out more about:

- My personal path if you wonder or prospect. 
- Material/Information if you are one of my students. 
- My everyday Physics if you bother.
- More Physics if you're starting from scratches. 
- Curiosity.
