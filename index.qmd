Hi! I'm Yoann and I'm a PhD student in **Early Universe Cosmology** at the Department of Applied Mathematics 
and Theoretical Physics at the **University of Cambridge**.

On this website, you will be able to find out more about:

- My personal path if you wonder or prospect. 
- Material/Information if you are one of my students. 
- My everyday Physics if you bother.
- More Physics if you're starting from scratches. 
- My own curiosities.

As a Norman born in Brittany and raised in a city with an undefined identity (is Nantes a Breton land? It is the millennium question), Yoann was perhaps fated for problems. His first encounter with space, and most importantly cosmology, was NOT while watching the stars, an apple falling from a tree, a rocket launching, or while reading *A Brief History of Time*. Yoann simply doesn’t remember, because he just likes to learn a lot and has limited storage space. You can identify him as a fraud French, self-proclaimed Viking, who doesn’t want to talk about croissants and Paris at the first occasion.

After realising that zookeeper was not his destiny, that heart surgeon would take too long to study, and that politics… well, anyway, he decided to do something involving maths. (*!Nerd alert!*) Maths were comforting and felt right, until an existential overdose when he realised that maybe he liked it mainly as a tool to answer day-to-day questions. He had a great time doing Physics in a *Grande École* in Paris, followed by a master’s in Cambridge. He started his academic research journey at the former, where he worked on reconstructing the quantum structure of crystals. In Cambridge, he started looking into theoretical physics, and eventually his own series of *?why?* questions converged (or diverged?) towards asking *?how?* about the whole thing (more commonly called *the Universe*).

In the past 3+ years, Yoann has studied the early, fast-expanding universe by extending Einstein’s equations of General Relativity to fluctuations generated by the quantum vacuum. In this process, he has also looked at the classicalisation of spacetime correlations and has produced and run cutting-edge simulations of the inflating universe (and still does). Pen, paper and supercomputer is a lovely routine of his.

After work, Yoann goes to sleep. But before that, cooking his meal is usually the highlight of the day, when not topped by learning guitar for the billionth time. As a standard STEM cliché, Yoann is also into hiking and bouldering. Beyond that, what is there to say, beyond the fact that entropy is non-decreasing.
