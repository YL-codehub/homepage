# I'm Yoann and you're on my personal website.

I'm a PhD student in **Quantum Cosmology** at the Department of Applied Mathematics 
and Theoretical Physics at the **University of Cambridge**.

The essence of this website is multiple but mainly professional and functional â€” 
hence a deliberately minimalist pattern.
