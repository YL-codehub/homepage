                    <h1> Research</h1>
                    <p>
                        My PhD project will advance the early universe theory of inflation, 
                        which explains the origin of galaxies and large-scale structure in the Universe,
                         by developing stochastic methods with nonlinear evolution to make quantitative 
                         statistical predictions from inflationary models. Non-Gaussian signatures are 
                         inherently present in primordial fluctuations due to the non-linearities produced 
                         by both general relativity and the fact that the inflaton potential responsible for 
                         driving inflation may be interacting. 
                         <br>
                         The goal of this project is to analytically and 
                         numerically model nonlinear inflationary dynamics in order to make bispectrum and 
                         higher-order correlator predictions which encompass a much broader range of 
                         inflationary scenarios, including those with multiple fields. This is an important 
                         discriminant between competing inflation models that can be used to distinguish them
                          observationally. An important element of the project will be to exploit the new 
                          GRChombo numerical relativity pipeline to model these nonlinear effects using full 3D
                           general relativistic simulations, comparing the results with perturbative analytic 
                           expectations from effective field theory. In the last years, consequent insights 
                           have been made by the DAMTP cosmology group lead by Dr. Paul Shellard, now able to 
                           constrain a wide range of these models by using innovative separable techniques to
                            extract and reconstruct the bispectrum (three-point correlator) from Planck 
                            satellite maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Direct confrontation with
                             new observational data sets, from both CMB experiments (Simons Observatory) and 
                             galaxy surveys (SDSS, DES etc), will guide and constrain the understanding of 
                             inflation in fundamental physics. These stochastic nonlinear methods have other 
                             wide-ranging applications, including the creation of primordial black holes and 
                             the generation of gravitational waves in the early universe.
